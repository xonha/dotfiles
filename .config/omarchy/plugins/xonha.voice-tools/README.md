Pick **Omavoice** in Zoom, Google Meet, OBS, or a browser. The plugin sits under those apps as a PipeWire source, so you do not configure each one. USB mics attach themselves when you plug them in.

An independent [MIT](LICENSE)-licensed plugin by [GigaSolo](https://github.com/gigasolo) for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) 4 (Quattro). Not affiliated with or endorsed by 37signals.

## Presets

| | Meeting | Podcast | Clean |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **For** | Zoom, Meet, Teams | OBS, interviews, local record | Program mixes, music beds |
| **Does** | Monitor-mode AEC + RNNoise mono + compressor | High-pass + DeepFilterNet3 (or RNNoise) + compressor | High-pass only |
| **Keeps** | Your voice on a laptop with speakers | Speech that sounds finished | Applause, keys, and music |

Right-click the mark to toggle. Open the panel to switch presets and pick a microphone. Each mic row shows a live level; the selected row adds a hairline of what Omavoice is sending.

In the app itself, choose **Omavoice** as the microphone and turn *its* noise cancellation off. Two denoisers stacked sound hollow.

## Install

```sh
omarchy pkg add noise-suppression-for-voice
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/gigasolo/omavoice.git --enable
```

Omarchy may ask which side of the bar to use. The default is the right.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Plugins run as unsandboxed code inside `omarchy-shell`. Only add repos you trust, and [read the source](https://github.com/gigasolo/omavoice) before you enable one.

Without `--enable`, the plugin is cloned and left off so you can review it first:

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/gigasolo/omavoice.git
less ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/xonha.voice-tools/README.md
omarchy plugin enable xonha.voice-tools --section right
```

From a local checkout:

```sh
omarchy plugin add "$PWD" --enable
```

Do not symlink the checkout into `~/.config/omarchy/plugins` — Omarchy refuses plugins that contain symlinks.

### Optional Podcast engine

```sh
omarchy pkg aur add libdeep_filter_ladspa-bin
```

If that plugin is missing, Podcast uses RNNoise. Meeting still echo-cancels without RNNoise, but the neural denoise needs `noise-suppression-for-voice`. After installing either package, click **reload** next to on/off. You do not restart the shell.

## Use

| Action | How |
| --- | --- |
| Open or close the panel | Left-click the mark |
| Tune a preset | Settings on PRESET, then Softer / Balanced / Stronger |
| Automatic microphone | AUTOMATIC on the MICROPHONE header |
| Toggle Omavoice | Right-click, or `o` |
| Reload processing | Reload next to on/off, or `r` |
| Meeting / Podcast / Clean | `m` / `p` / `c` |
| Move | Arrow keys or `h` `j` `k` `l` |
| Activate | Enter |
| Close | Escape |

USB capture is preferred when it appears. Laptop mics and Bluetooth headsets stay in the picker. Pin one if you have several USB devices.

## How it sits in the graph

```
USB / laptop / BT mic
        │
        ▼
  Omavoice  (pipewire -c, its own client)
   Meeting · Podcast · Clean
        │
        ▼
  Zoom · Meet · OBS · browser
```

The host is a dedicated PipeWire client, the same isolation Omarchy uses for speaker tuning. It does not write into that tuning, and it does not load stock `filter-chain.conf.d`. Disable the plugin and the chain stops.

## While it's running

Meeting echo cancel can use CPU while speakers play, even with no call. After meters and `pw-cat` run only while the panel is open. Disable the plugin to stop the host.

## Update and remove

```sh
omarchy plugin update xonha.voice-tools
omarchy plugin remove xonha.voice-tools
```

`omarchy plugin update` shows the diff and fast-forwards the git checkout. Removing the plugin does not change your other audio devices.

## If something is wrong

**The mark is missing.** Confirm it is enabled:

```sh
omarchy plugin list | grep omavoice
omarchy plugin enable xonha.voice-tools --section right
```

**The panel asks for RNNoise.** Run `omarchy pkg add noise-suppression-for-voice`, or click the setup row, then **reload**.

**The app still hears the raw USB mic.** Select **Omavoice** inside Zoom / Meet / OBS, not the hardware device.

**The voice sounds hollow.** The call app is probably denoising too. Turn that off.

## Develop

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gigasolo/omavoice.git
cd omavoice
./tests/run
```

That runs the Model tests and `omarchy plugin validate .`, the same checks Omarchy uses before it will install a plugin.

## Sharing

Omarchy distributes third-party plugins as public git repos. Anyone can run `omarchy plugin add` against this URL.
