Omarchy (Quickshell) bar-widget plugin that shows the next calendar event and
lets you click to join Google Meet. NOT a Node app — the runtime is QML.

## Architecture

- `manifest.json` is the plugin descriptor; `entryPoints.barWidget` = `BarWidget.qml`. `kinds: ["bar-widget"]`.
- QML layer: `BarWidget.qml` (bar widget) and `Panel.qml` (agenda popup), decomposed into modular QML components under `components/` (`Tokens.qml`, `HeaderBar.qml`, `HeroCard.qml`, `ScheduleGroup.qml`, `ScheduleRow.qml`, `CalendarLegend.qml`, `SetupGuide.qml`, `SetupCard.qml`, `EmptySchedule.qml`, `SettingsView.qml`, `SettingStepper.qml`, `SettingField.qml`, `SettingKeyInput.qml`, `FeedCard.qml`, `SourceModeSwitcher.qml`). These own all Qt/Quickshell UI, fetching (Quickshell.Io), and widget settings.
- UI Component Architecture: Follow atomic design principles by decomposing complex views into small, focused, single-responsibility components under `components/`. Do NOT use artificial naming schemes (no "atoms", "molecules", "organisms" in file names or folders) — name components directly by their domain purpose (e.g. `SettingField.qml`, `SettingKeyInput.qml`, `FeedCard.qml`, `SourceModeSwitcher.qml`). Parent views coordinate layout while subcomponents encapsulate their own styling, focus handling, and interaction states. All components must be registered in `components/qmldir` and use `Tokens.qml` for spacing, typography dimming, and styling constants.
- `Model.js` is the pure-JS core and single source of truth: iCalendar parsing, RRULE/DTSTART recurrence expansion, VTIMEZONE/DST handling, display labels, domain classes (`CalendarEvent`, `TimezoneResolver`, `RecurrenceRule`, `RecurrenceExpander`, `MeetingLinkDetector`, `IcsParser`, `JsonStateParser`, `FeedConfigParser`, `ScheduleAggregator`, `DisplayFormatter`, `PanelNavigationModel`), and navigation. No Qt/Quickshell imports.
- `Model.js` is imported two ways: QML does `import "Model.js" as Model`; Node does `require("./Model.js")` for tests. Keep every constant and helper function top-level (QML exposes them directly) and keep the `module.exports` guard at the bottom — the guard is what makes it require-able in Node.

## Critical runtime constraints

- QML's V4 engine has **no `Intl`**. Model.js must work without it. Timezone resolution order is: VTIMEZONE table → `Intl` if the engine has it → naive local fallback. Do not add `Intl`-dependent logic to Model.js without a fallback (there is a dedicated test simulating the no-Intl engine).
- TZID table is reset at the start of every `parseIcs`/`registerVTimezones`. A feed that drops a zone must not resolve against stale data — this is a tested invariant; don't make the table accumulate across parses.
- Keep `Model.js` dependency-free (pure). The QML sandbox cannot load npm packages; runtime deps are not possible.
- **PlainText text format on all QML `Text` items**: Qt Quick `Text` items default to `Text.AutoText`, which evaluates strings containing HTML tags as rich text and can load remote images / tracking pixels inside the shell process. Always explicitly specify `textFormat: Text.PlainText` on all `Text` items rendering feed-derived content (event titles, locations, descriptions, calendar labels) and UI text.

## Tests & Tooling

```sh
npm test          # node --test test/*.test.js
npm run lint      # eslint .
npm run format    # prettier --write .
```

Comprehensive test suites in `test/*.test.js` cover:
- `TimezoneResolver`: `parseTzOffset`, VTIMEZONE DST transitions (BYDAY incl. negative ordinals, BYMONTHDAY), `zonedToUtc` round-trips against the system tz database, no-Intl fallback, and per-parse table reset.
- `MeetingLinkDetector`: `VIDEO_PROVIDERS` patterns, `findMeetUrl`, `meetLabel`, and decoy link rejection across Meet, Zoom, Teams, Webex, and GoTo fixtures.
- `IcsParser` & `RecurrenceExpander`: iCalendar unfolding, unescaping, RFC 5545 recurrence rules (`DAILY`, `WEEKLY`, `MONTHLY`, `YEARLY`), EXDATE exclusions, and RECURRENCE-ID overrides.
- `JsonStateParser`: Omarchy local sync JSON parsing, declined invite filtering, and date parsing.
- `ScheduleAggregator`: Event sorting, upcoming/ongoing buckets, all-day vs timed event prioritization, and day grouping.
- `DisplayFormatter`: Header status, countdown strings, duration formatting, and tooltip generation.
- `PanelNavigationModel`: Keyboard and hover cursor indexing.

Tests cover domain JS only; the QML layer has no automated coverage.

## Workflow conventions

- Contributions follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, ...) with a mandatory body explaining *why* (the problem being solved, rationale, and design decisions), and a strictly linear history (rebase, no merge commits). See README's Contributing section.
- Widget settings are configured via `omarchy bar set tobiasz-p.next-event <key> <value>`; defaults live in the README table (e.g. `icsUrl`, `refreshMinutes`, `showDaysAhead`).

## Releasing

- Merge all PRs **before** tagging. The marketplace verifies exact commit snapshots, which are immutable once published — a feature missing from a tagged release can only be fixed by cutting a new version, never by moving the tag.
- Semver from Conventional Commits: `fix:` → patch, `feat:` → minor, breaking → major.
- Bump `version` in `manifest.json`, commit as `chore: bump version to X.Y.Z`, then tag without the `v` prefix and push both:
  `git tag -a X.Y.Z -m "X.Y.Z" && git push origin main X.Y.Z`
- Create the GitHub release with notes covering changes since the previous tag:
  `gh release create X.Y.Z --title "X.Y.Z" --notes "..."`
- Ask for marketplace verification with a `[Verify]` issue on HANCORE-linux/omarchy-plugin-marketplace (verify-plugin.yml template): action "Verify and publish a newer upstream commit", plugin ID `tobiasz-p.next-event`, repo URL `https://github.com/tobiasz-p/next-event`, and the full 40-char SHA of the release commit. A bot validates, runs a security baseline, then a maintainer applies `approved-and-verified` and publishes that exact snapshot.
  Create the issue with:
  ```
  gh issue create --repo HANCORE-linux/omarchy-plugin-marketplace --title "[Verify] tobiasz-p.next-event X.Y.Z" --body "### Verification action

  Verify and publish a newer upstream commit

  ### Plugin ID

  tobiasz-p.next-event

  ### Repository URL

  https://github.com/tobiasz-p/next-event

  ### Target commit

  <full-40-char-sha>

  ### Verification acknowledgment

  - [x] I understand that only the exact target commit can become a verified marketplace snapshot and that verification is not a security audit.

  ### Standard installation acknowledgment

  - [x] I confirm that this listed root plugin supports the standard Omarchy installation path and does not require manual setup."
