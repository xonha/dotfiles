# Changelog

All notable changes to Omavoice are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.24] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Marketplace preview is a cropped shot of the live panel, with the preset
  tune page in `docs/preview-tune.png`.

## [0.1.23] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- Reload next to on/off (same icon as HEY and Fizzy) rebuilds the chain after
  you install RNNoise or DeepFilterNet. No shell restart.

## [0.1.22] — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Podcast optional engine install is `libdeep_filter_ladspa-bin`. There is no
  AUR package named `deepfilternet-ladspa`.

## [0.1.21] — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- `omavoice-run --dump` no longer overwrites the live host config. Running
  tests had pointed the chain at a fake TEST_MIC, so Omavoice never bound
  and After meters stayed empty.

## [0.1.20] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- Marketplace `preview.png` of the open panel.

### Changed

- Track capture sources only, and refresh the mic list when PipeWire
  nodes change instead of polling every 750 ms.
- Mark Omavoice as a virtual Communication source with a 3s suspend
  timeout, and keep mono capture from being remixed.
- README lists the plugin at [plugins.omarchy.org](https://plugins.omarchy.org)
  and notes Meeting AEC cost while speakers play.

### Removed

- Unused wave-orb PNGs. The bar and README keep the microphone mark.

## [0.1.19] — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- After meters show the processed level on first panel open after an
  update. The hold used to attach before PipeWire bound the `omavoice`
  name, so After sat at Before until a no-op preset toggle recreated the
  node.

## [0.1.18] — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- After meters work again. The panel hold used `node.dont-fallback`, which
  made `pw-cat` fail to attach to Omavoice, so the chain stayed suspended.
  The hold now targets the live node id.

## [0.1.17] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- PRESET tuning uses a settings cog, not a wrench.
- MICROPHONE uses the same AUTOMATIC header toggle as the network panel.

## [0.1.16] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Bar, panel, and README use the original microphone mark again.

## [0.1.15] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Bar, panel, and README use the rendered wave orb (`4.jpg`) as a PNG, so
  the mark matches the image instead of a traced SVG.

## [0.1.14] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Preset tuning lives on PRESET: a wrench flips to Softer / Balanced /
  Stronger for Meeting and Podcast.
- Auto-select sits on the MICROPHONE header, next to the device list.
- The hero is on/off only. Each control sits in the section it belongs to.

## [0.1.13] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Wave mark is a close-cropped orb with four long arcs, matching the
  reference image — not a small circle with short ticks.

## [0.1.12] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Processing stops are **Softer**, **Balanced**, and **Stronger**, with a
  line of copy that says what each does for Meeting and Podcast.
- Mark is the long-wave orb as SVG, used in the bar, the panel, and the
  README.

## [0.1.11] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- Settings has a three-stop slider for **Meeting** and **Podcast**: Good,
  Better, Best. Default is Better (today’s tune). Good is gentler; Best
  is tighter. Clean is unchanged.

## [0.1.10] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- On/off is the original pill toggle again. Settings is a matching bordered
  button, same height, centered with it.
- Mark is a square **O** with the mic capsule cut out, so it no longer
  squashes a portrait silhouette into a square.

## [0.1.9] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Header matches HEY: a larger microphone, with settings and power as the
  same icon buttons, vertically centered.

## [0.1.8] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Meeting VAD is 80% with a 400 ms grace so word endings are not clipped.
- README banner uses the same microphone as the bar, with the line **Your
  voice, better heard.** The lead no longer talks about a record button.

### Added

- A settings page, flipped like HEY: cog on the hero, back arrow to return.
  One control — **Default microphone** — so apps pick Omavoice automatically.

## [0.1.7] — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Preset and on/off switches no longer drop the selected mic while PipeWire
  rebinds node names, which was restarting the host extra times and making
  the call stutter.
- After meters wait for the new Omavoice node before `pw-cat` holds the
  graph, and they refuse to fall back to another source. Peak monitors are
  rebound after each graph generation so Before/After stay honest without
  closing the panel.

## [0.1.6] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Peak meters sit on the microphone rows. Each row shows that device’s live
  level; the selected row adds a hairline **After** for Omavoice. The silent
  `pw-cat` hold still runs while the panel is open so After moves without a
  call.

### Removed

- Listen (headphones), including the panel toggle, middle-click, and `l`.
  The chain is what Zoom hears; a speaker monitor was a feedback trap.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- Open panel shows Before and After peak meters (raw mic vs Omavoice), using
  the same PipeWire peak monitor as the Omarchy audio panel. A silent
  `pw-cat` hold keeps the filter-chain flowing so After moves without a
  call. Meters and the hold stop when the panel closes.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Bar mark is a microphone, tinted like HEY’s SVG icon, with a tooltip for
  off / preset / error.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Meeting no longer registers **Omavoice echo cancel** as a second microphone.
  That node is the AEC stage feeding Omavoice; it is now
  `Stream/Output/Audio/Internal` so pickers only show **Omavoice**.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Meeting echo cancel now uses `monitor.mode = true` so WebRTC AEC reads the
  default sink’s monitor instead of a virtual sink Zoom/Meet never play into.
  The isolated client maps `audio.aec` to `libspa-aec-webrtc`; without that
  the module was skipped. Do not force MONO/`node.latency` on the AEC module
  itself — that SIGFPE’d against a stereo speaker monitor.
- Disabled `webrtc.gain_control`; PipeWire’s WebRTC backend documents that AGC
  wrecks delay-agnostic AEC, especially on speech.

### Changed

- Denoisers run **mono** (`noise_suppressor_mono` / `deep_filter_mono`) at
  48 kHz with `node.latency = 256/48000`.
- Meeting RNNoise VAD is 85% with a 200 ms grace; Podcast grace matches.
- DeepFilterNet attenuation cap is 70 dB (was unlimited 100 dB).
- Meeting and Podcast add a light LSP compressor + limiter after denoise so
  speech does not come out thin.
- Bluetooth sources show a narrow-band warning in the panel.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- Panel no longer sticks on **Starting…** after the PipeWire host is already
  running. Quickshell leaves `PwNode.name` empty until a `PwObjectTracker`
  binds the node (the same contract `omarchy.audio` uses). Omavoice now binds
  non-stream nodes, treats the host process as running, and only uses the
  bound source to promote the default input.
- Clicking a microphone in the panel now selects it. The live source list was
  rebuilt on every PipeWire poll, which destroyed the row under the pointer
  before `onClicked` fired. The open panel now snapshots the list, source
  snapshots are reused when names have not changed, and the active mic uses
  CursorSurface `current` so the selection is visible.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-03

### Added

- Omarchy 4 plugin (`gigasolo.omavoice`) that publishes a virtual PipeWire
  source named **Omavoice** for Zoom, Meet, OBS, and browsers.
- Three presets: **Meeting** (WebRTC echo cancel + RNNoise), **Podcast**
  (DeepFilterNet3 when installed, otherwise RNNoise), **Clean** (high-pass
  only).
- USB capture preferred automatically when it appears; laptop and Bluetooth
  mics stay in the picker.
- Isolated `pipewire -c` host, same pattern as Omarchy speaker tuning.
- Bar widget with on/off, presets, listen (headphones), and RNNoise setup
  guidance.
- MIT license (GigaSolo LLC).
