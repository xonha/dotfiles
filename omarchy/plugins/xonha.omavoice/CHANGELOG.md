# Changelog

All notable changes to Omavoice are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.2] — 2026-09-21

Stereo USB remix and a stable Auto pick.

### Fixed

- Stereo USB capture remixes into the MONO graph. `dont-remix` stays only
  on the published Omavoice source, so Zoom does not stereo-expand it.
- Auto no longer hops between USB mics when PipeWire reorders the node
  list. Pin and a USB session default still win.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- Leftover PipeWire nodes are destroyed with `pw-cli` argv and a
  non-negative integer id. `pw-dump` ids are not interpolated into a
  shell (`os.system`).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-08

Voice looks, pinned capture, honest meters. Notes, NVIDIA, and Speex are
not in this release.

### Added

- Voice looks on PRESET tune (Neutral / Warm / Clear / Bright) and Body /
  Presence / Air knobs on a fixed ±12 dB scale (writes still clamp to look
  ±6). Meeting defaults Warm, Podcast Clear. On Clean, Voice stays visible
  and disabled. Live biquads, no host restart. NVIDIA and Speex are not in
  this cut.

### Fixed

- Meeting no longer captures a Bluetooth headset when the laptop mic is
  selected. Capture stays pinned to the named target (`dont-fallback`,
  `linger`, `dont-move`). The panel meters only the chosen row. Unpinned
  Bluetooth no longer beats the builtin mic.
- Meeting no longer `pw-link`s the default sink into `omavoice.aec.sink`
  when a call starts. That classic AEC path, on top of `monitor.mode`,
  sent far-end audio back to Google Meet. Echo cancel stays
  `monitor.mode` only.
- Disable restores the pinned microphone, not a leftover Bluetooth default.
- Switching preset, engine, or microphone still restarts the host. The
  hero names the wait (**Starting Podcast…**, **Starting RNNoise…**,
  **Switching microphone…**, **Reloading…**) instead of spinning the
  power switch, and the control you clicked dims until Omavoice is back.

### Changed

- Marketplace `preview.png` is the live panel; `docs/preview-tune.png` is
  the Voice looks page.
- Input / Output faders are out of this cut. Isolated filter-chain mixer
  writes do not drive the DSP, and restarting the host on release is the
  wrong product. The selected mic keeps Before (device) and After
  (Omavoice) meters so noise suppression is visible.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-06

Live level and engine picker. Notes is not in this release.

### Added

- Live filter-chain controls: named `preamp` / `outgain` stages and
  `pw-cli` Props writes, so Softer/Stronger no longer restarts the host.
- Per-preset **Output** and **Input** gain (−12…+12 dB). Chevron on the
  selected mic opens both (hover: Level). Snap 0.5 dB, detent at 0.
- Engine picker on the PRESET tune page: Auto / RNNoise / DeepFilterNet,
  with hover tips. Fill is the pick; a corner dot is the live engine, and
  only when Auto is selected. Meeting can run DeepFilterNet with AEC still
  on. Engines never stack.
- Setup row for a missing chosen engine, including DeepFilterNet’s
  `libdeep_filter_ladspa-bin` install line.

### Changed

- Level chevron points left when closed and down when open.
- Marketplace `preview.png` is the live panel with Level open; `docs/preview-tune.png` is the engine picker.

### Fixed

- Auto remembers the real microphone after Omavoice becomes the default
  source, and prefers a Bluetooth headset over the laptop mic when nothing
  is pinned. Disable restores that capture, not `omavoice`.
- Host configs are `0600` and leftover `host.*.conf` files are removed on
  start. `--target` must be a safe PipeWire node name.
- After meters come back after a plugin update without clicking Reload.
  A remount used to truncate `host.conf` while `pipewire -c` parsed it,
  leaving an empty process on D-Bus with no `omavoice` node. Each host
  now writes a pid-unique conf, only kills leftover `pipewire` binaries,
  and restarts until the bound node shows up.

## [0.1.24] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Marketplace preview is a cropped shot of the live panel, with the preset
  tune page in `docs/preview-tune.png`.

## [0.1.23] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- Reload next to on/off (same icon as HEY and Fizzy) rebuilds the chain after
  you install RNNoise or DeepFilterNet. No shell restart.

## [0.1.22] — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Podcast optional engine install is `libdeep_filter_ladspa-bin`. There is no
  AUR package named `deepfilternet-ladspa`.

## [0.1.21] — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- `omavoice-run --dump` no longer overwrites the live host config. Running
  tests had pointed the chain at a fake TEST_MIC, so Omavoice never bound
  and After meters stayed empty.

## [0.1.20] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- Marketplace `preview.png` of the open panel.

### Changed

- Track capture sources only, and refresh the mic list when PipeWire
  nodes change instead of polling every 750 ms.
- Mark Omavoice as a virtual Communication source with a 3s suspend
  timeout, and keep mono capture from being remixed.
- README lists the plugin at [plugins.omarchy.org](https://plugins.omarchy.org)
  and notes Meeting AEC cost while speakers play.

### Removed

- Unused wave-orb PNGs. The bar and README keep the microphone mark.

## [0.1.19] — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- After meters show the processed level on first panel open after an
  update. The hold used to attach before PipeWire bound the `omavoice`
  name, so After sat at Before until a no-op preset toggle recreated the
  node.

## [0.1.18] — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- After meters work again. The panel hold used `node.dont-fallback`, which
  made `pw-cat` fail to attach to Omavoice, so the chain stayed suspended.
  The hold now targets the live node id.

## [0.1.17] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- PRESET tuning uses a settings cog, not a wrench.
- MICROPHONE uses the same AUTOMATIC header toggle as the network panel.

## [0.1.16] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Bar, panel, and README use the original microphone mark again.

## [0.1.15] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Bar, panel, and README use the rendered wave orb (`4.jpg`) as a PNG, so
  the mark matches the image instead of a traced SVG.

## [0.1.14] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Preset tuning lives on PRESET: a wrench flips to Softer / Balanced /
  Stronger for Meeting and Podcast.
- Auto-select sits on the MICROPHONE header, next to the device list.
- The hero is on/off only. Each control sits in the section it belongs to.

## [0.1.13] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Wave mark is a close-cropped orb with four long arcs, matching the
  reference image — not a small circle with short ticks.

## [0.1.12] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Processing stops are **Softer**, **Balanced**, and **Stronger**, with a
  line of copy that says what each does for Meeting and Podcast.
- Mark is the long-wave orb as SVG, used in the bar, the panel, and the
  README.

## [0.1.11] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- Settings has a three-stop slider for **Meeting** and **Podcast**: Good,
  Better, Best. Default is Better (today’s tune). Good is gentler; Best
  is tighter. Clean is unchanged.

## [0.1.10] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- On/off is the original pill toggle again. Settings is a matching bordered
  button, same height, centered with it.
- Mark is a square **O** with the mic capsule cut out, so it no longer
  squashes a portrait silhouette into a square.

## [0.1.9] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Header matches HEY: a larger microphone, with settings and power as the
  same icon buttons, vertically centered.

## [0.1.8] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Meeting VAD is 80% with a 400 ms grace so word endings are not clipped.
- README banner uses the same microphone as the bar, with the line **Your
  voice, better heard.** The lead no longer talks about a record button.

### Added

- A settings page, flipped like HEY: cog on the hero, back arrow to return.
  One control — **Default microphone** — so apps pick Omavoice automatically.

## [0.1.7] — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Preset and on/off switches no longer drop the selected mic while PipeWire
  rebinds node names, which was restarting the host extra times and making
  the call stutter.
- After meters wait for the new Omavoice node before `pw-cat` holds the
  graph, and they refuse to fall back to another source. Peak monitors are
  rebound after each graph generation so Before/After stay honest without
  closing the panel.

## [0.1.6] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Peak meters sit on the microphone rows. Each row shows that device’s live
  level; the selected row adds a hairline **After** for Omavoice. The silent
  `pw-cat` hold still runs while the panel is open so After moves without a
  call.

### Removed

- Listen (headphones), including the panel toggle, middle-click, and `l`.
  The chain is what Zoom hears; a speaker monitor was a feedback trap.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-09-04

### Added

- Open panel shows Before and After peak meters (raw mic vs Omavoice), using
  the same PipeWire peak monitor as the Omarchy audio panel. A silent
  `pw-cat` hold keeps the filter-chain flowing so After moves without a
  call. Meters and the hold stop when the panel closes.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Bar mark is a microphone, tinted like HEY’s SVG icon, with a tooltip for
  off / preset / error.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Meeting no longer registers **Omavoice echo cancel** as a second microphone.
  That node is the AEC stage feeding Omavoice; it is now
  `Stream/Output/Audio/Internal` so pickers only show **Omavoice**.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Meeting echo cancel now uses `monitor.mode = true` so WebRTC AEC reads the
  default sink’s monitor instead of a virtual sink Zoom/Meet never play into.
  The isolated client maps `audio.aec` to `libspa-aec-webrtc`; without that
  the module was skipped. Do not force MONO/`node.latency` on the AEC module
  itself — that SIGFPE’d against a stereo speaker monitor.
- Disabled `webrtc.gain_control`; PipeWire’s WebRTC backend documents that AGC
  wrecks delay-agnostic AEC, especially on speech.

### Changed

- Denoisers run **mono** (`noise_suppressor_mono` / `deep_filter_mono`) at
  48 kHz with `node.latency = 256/48000`.
- Meeting RNNoise VAD is 85% with a 200 ms grace; Podcast grace matches.
- DeepFilterNet attenuation cap is 70 dB (was unlimited 100 dB).
- Meeting and Podcast add a light LSP compressor + limiter after denoise so
  speech does not come out thin.
- Bluetooth sources show a narrow-band warning in the panel.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- Panel no longer sticks on **Starting…** after the PipeWire host is already
  running. Quickshell leaves `PwNode.name` empty until a `PwObjectTracker`
  binds the node (the same contract `omarchy.audio` uses). Omavoice now binds
  non-stream nodes, treats the host process as running, and only uses the
  bound source to promote the default input.
- Clicking a microphone in the panel now selects it. The live source list was
  rebuilt on every PipeWire poll, which destroyed the row under the pointer
  before `onClicked` fired. The open panel now snapshots the list, source
  snapshots are reused when names have not changed, and the active mic uses
  CursorSurface `current` so the selection is visible.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-03

### Added

- Omarchy 4 plugin (`gigasolo.omavoice`) that publishes a virtual PipeWire
  source named **Omavoice** for Zoom, Meet, OBS, and browsers.
- Three presets: **Meeting** (WebRTC echo cancel + RNNoise), **Podcast**
  (DeepFilterNet3 when installed, otherwise RNNoise), **Clean** (high-pass
  only).
- USB capture preferred automatically when it appears; laptop and Bluetooth
  mics stay in the picker.
- Isolated `pipewire -c` host, same pattern as Omarchy speaker tuning.
- Bar widget with on/off, presets, listen (headphones), and RNNoise setup
  guidance.
- MIT license (GigaSolo LLC).
